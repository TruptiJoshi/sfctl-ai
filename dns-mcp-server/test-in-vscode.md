# Testing MCP Server Integration

If your MCP server (DNS Lookup) is correctly configured in VS Code with Cursor, you should be able to request DNS lookups directly from AI.

For example, you could ask:

- "Can you look up the DNS records for example.com and tell me what you find?"
- "What are the DNS records for github.com? Can you format them in a table?"
- "Compare the DNS records for google.com and microsoft.com."

If the MCP server is working correctly, the AI should be able to use the DNS lookup tool to perform these lookups and provide real-time DNS information.
